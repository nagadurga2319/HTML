<h1>Assignment 1: Basic HTML Display Features</h1>
</center>
<p>A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story
 with great graphical and analytical presentation. </p>
<p>Using the &quot;View&quot; option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color choices. The body color
 indicates white and the text as being black. I could have just written in &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; instead of these codes.

<p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule: </p>
<hr>
<p>To begin, we can change the </p>
<h2>header size</h2>
and <font color="blue">color</font> <font color="#ff0000">of</font> <font color="#008080">
letters</font> seen on the screen. The <font size="+2">font size</font>can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices.
<p>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked quote.
</p>
<blockquote><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif">Now is the <em>time </em>
for all good <strong>people</strong> to <b>come </b>to the <i>aid</i> of their country.
</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">That was also an example of a nested command.
