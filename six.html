<p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. 
"Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.</p>

<p>The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, 
human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

<b>Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much more are part of nature. </b>
